# Master Nuxt.js
Code from the course Master Nuxt.js on Udemy

## It's free!! Grab it while you can!
You can clone this repo or fork it if you want, or just use it for looking up things when you're doing the Master Nuxt.js course on Udemy. The teacher from the course has the code available on his GitHub as well, but you will notice that his code is out of date now. Nuxt2 had several updates already and soon Nuxt3 will be out. Hopefully my code can help you solving your issues that you will get (and believe me you will, and you will get frustrated), I just want to help you out with this, taking somewhat of your frustrations away and especially helping you not to waste too much time on looking stuff up instead of following the course.
